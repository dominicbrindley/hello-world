# hello-world
This repository is to practice GitHub Flow. 


I am Dominic Brindley and I am a novice to GitHub and I am excited to learn! I am currently in my second to last semester
at Lakeland Community College to accuire my Associates Degree. I am twenty-four years old, and this is my seccond time taking 
classes at Lakeland. I first took classes for Graphic Design in the 2019-2020 year, however in the Spring Semester of 2020
the Covid pandemic hit forcing all classes to go online, and much more complex things in life. During that time i lost all dedication
to class and eventually dropped out of school. Although, in the summer of 2023 i decided to comeback to Lakeland and finish what i started,
albeit, with a degree change.

Some hobbies of mine include, Graphic Design, Playing video games with my friends, and I love watching, and diving into the stats and small details in sports.
